# Hello Hybrid

## Code

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="hybrid.c" %}
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "mpi.h"
#include <omp.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int numprocs, rank, namelen;
  char processor_name[MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME];
  int iam = 0, np = 1;

  MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
  MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &numprocs);
  MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
  MPI_Get_processor_name(processor_name, &namelen);

  #pragma omp parallel default(shared) private(iam, np)

  MPI_Finalize();

## Compiling

1. Load modules:

   ```text
   [user@login01 HYBRID]$ module purge
   [user@login01 HYBRID]$ module load slurm
   [user@login01 HYBRID]$ module load cpu
   [user@login01 HYBRID]$ module load intel
   [user@login01 HYBRID]$ module load intel-mpi
   [user@login01 HYBRID]$ export I_MPI_CC=icc 
   ```

2. Compile the code:

   ```text
   [user@login01 HYBRID]$ mpicc -qopenmp -o hello_hybrid hybrid.c
   ```

## Submission

```text
[user@login01 HYBRID]$ sbatch hybrid-slurm.sb
Submitted batch job 1089019
[...]
```

## Output
